1. Truss Analysis by Method of joints

If a truss is in equilibrium, then each of its joints must also be in equilibrium.<br/>
The method of joints consists of satisfying the equilibrium conditions for the forces exerted on the pin at each joint of the truss.<br/>
Truss members are all straight two-force members lying in the same plane.<br/>
The force system acting at each pin is coplanar and concurrent (intersecting)<br/>
Rotational or moment equilibrium is automatically satisfied at the joint, only need to satisfy &#8721; Fx = 0, &#8721; Fy = 0 <br/>
Draw the free-body diagram of a joint having at least one known force and at most two unknown forces (may need to first determine external reactions at the truss supports)<br/>
Establish the sense of the unknown forces<br/>
Always assume the unknown member forces acting on the joints free-body diagram to be in tension (pulling on the pin)<br/>
Assume what is believed to be the correct sense of an unknown member force<br/>
In both cases a negative value indicates that the sense chosen must be reversed<br/>
Orient the x and y axes such that the forces can be easily resolved into their x and y components<br/>
Apply &#8721; Fx = 0 and &#8721; Fy = 0 and solve for the unknown member forces and verify their correct sense<br/>
Continue to analyze each of the other joints, choosing ones having at most two unknowns and at least one known force<br/>
Members in compression push on the joint and members in tension pull on the joint<br/>
Mechanics of Materials and building codes are used to size the members once the forces are known<br/>
